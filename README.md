This is a modular inventory management system designed to streamline inventory tracking, vendor communication, and basic sales forecasting. It supports authentication through ID card verification, real-time display of inventory and sales information, and automated vendor notifications. A simple sales prediction module is also being integrated to estimate demand for the following day based on historical trends.

Features
ID Card-Based Authentication
The system verifies user identity through ID card scanning or input before allowing access to administrative or transactional functions.

Inventory Display
Real-time dashboard showing stock levels, low-stock items, total items, daily sales, and order history.

Vendor Notification via Email
Automatically sends email alerts to registered vendors when item quantities fall below defined thresholds.

Sales Forecasting (In Progress)
A basic machine learning model is being developed to predict next-day sales volumes using historical sales data. This will assist in optimizing reordering and minimizing stock-outs.

Modular Architecture
Designed with modular components for future scalability. Each functional area (authentication, display, communication, prediction) is separated for easy maintenance and expansion.
